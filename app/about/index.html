<h1>Hey!  I'm Erin Gunn</h1>

<p>I am the sole member of Ikonic Games.  I manage everything from development and design to business and marketing.  My goal is to build a sustainable business making HTML5 and crossplatform video games.  Currently, I am focussing solely on the HTML5 side of the business.</p>

<p>When I am not making video games, you can find me <a href="http://vachaventures.com/">travelling South America with my girlfriend</a>, surfing, climbing, whitewater kayaking, or just about any activity that has the potential to maim me. I like to live my life as if I have a reset button.</p>
<p>Thank you for checking out my site and enjoy my games!</p>
