<h3>Hello, I'm Erin Gunn.</h3>

<p>I am the sole member of Ikonic Games.  I manage everything from development and design to business and marketing.  My goal is to build a sustainable business making HTML5 and crossplatform video games.  Currently, I am focussing solely on the HTML5 side of the business.</p>
<p>I enjoy making games of all genres, with a focus on smaller games with catchy mechanics.  Most of my games are playable on just about any device you can find that has a web browser.</p>
<p>On this site, I also keep a blog where I discuss my development process and tools and write tutorials on their use.  I am in love with the idea of giving back to the game development community that has already given me so much.</p>
<p>If you would like to get in touch with me or follow my progress, my social media accounts are on the sidebar to the right, as well as my email list.</p>
