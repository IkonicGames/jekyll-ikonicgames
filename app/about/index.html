<h1>Hey!  I'm Erin Gunn</h1>

<p>You can usually find me making computer games or learning how to be better at making computer games. I have 5 years experience making games and it is the only thing that I have learned to do that has never left my mind since I started. Normally I use Haxe/HaxeFlixel to make my games but I also really enjoy using C# with Unity when I want to play with something 3D.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not staring at a computer screen, <a href="http://vachaventures.com/">you can find me travelling South America with my girlfriend</a>, surfing, climbing, whitewater kayaking, or just about any other activity I can find that has the potential to kill or maim me. I like to live my life as if I have a reset button.</p>

<p>Thank you for checking out my site!</p>
