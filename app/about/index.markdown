####Hi, thanks for stopping by!  My name is Erin Gunn.####

I am the core member of Ikonic Games.  I create games with a focus on catchy, simple and original gameplay.  My games are developed primarily for mobile and desktop browsers.

My skills range from programming and project managment to design and user experience.  To ensure that I am delivering the highest quality product possible, I often work with freelancers to supplement my skillset.
