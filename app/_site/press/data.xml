			<header>Founding History</header>
			<text>Ikonic Games was founded in 2014 by Erin Gunn as a place for him to share the games that he creates.  Sicne he found his work as an IT Guy for a school unfulfilling, he has been working on turning his prototypes into fully functioning games for everyone to enjoy.</text>

			<header>July 2015 - Present</header>
			<text>In mid-2014, the decision was made between Erin and his Girlfriend that they would take an extended holiday and travel South America.  The travel plans are simply to visit Columbia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Pery, Argentina and Chile.  The trip started in Bogota, Columbia(because the plane tickets were >$200) and is making its way south at whatever pace the decide.  Along the way, Erin will be "busking" mobile games in an attempt to extend the trip.</text>
